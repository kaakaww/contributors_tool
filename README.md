## Local Repository
The GitHub version of this tool will help inspect a single local repository. 
This will output the path of the repo and the committers on said repo for the last 90 day 
development period.

```console
usage: local-repo-committers.py [-h] [--dir DIR] 

Count developers on a GitHub repo or in a GitHub Organization for the last 90 days

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --dir DIR
                        Path to the local repository. Defaults to current working directory
  
```

Here's an alternative way to verify these results with a command-line command:
```console
git shortlog -sen --all --since=$(date -j -v-90d -f %Y-%m-%d $(git log --pretty="%ad" --date=short -1 --all) +%Y-%m-%d) | cat - | grep -v '\<root@\w\+\>' | wc -l
```
This has been verified on a Mac. Commands may differ on a Linux environment. Removing the `| wc-l` will allow you to inspect the results.
